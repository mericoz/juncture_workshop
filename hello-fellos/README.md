## Using IIIF

.ve-media https://media.getty.edu/iiif/pres/8078f5e0-244f-4720-8dcc-57716e2ade3b 

I used [this link](https://iiif.io/guides/finding_resources/) to find an IIIF compliant source. I used the [Getty Search Gateway](https://search.getty.edu/gateway/landing) to look for something interesting to me.

Once I found an item that I was looking for, I scrolled until I found the [Manifest URL](https://iiif.io/guides/using_iiif_resources/).

## Add Popover Links and Texts

I like to add pop over links, retrieving info from a source like ==Wikidata=={Q2013} . For whatever reason, this function didn't work on my Readme. Can you try and tell me what I did wrong?

Note how I added an annotation onto the image. That function is accessible on the viewer itself.


## Chitwan National Park, Nepal

.ve-map 41.01, 28.98

The map is centered on the Chitwan National Park in Nepal, which is the location associated with the image above.  The Wikidata identifier for Chitwan National Park is `Q1075023`.  When a map location is specified using a Wikidata ID (or QID) Juncture can automatically retrieve the geographic coordinates for map centering.

An alternative to using a Wikidata identifier for map positioning is to use regular latitude and longitude coordinates.  In that approach the QID would be replaced with the coordinates `27.5,84.333`, resulting in an identical map.

Similar to the image viewer, map zooming is controlled using the buttons located in the top-left corner of the map viewer.  Panning is performed with the keyboard arrow keys or by mouse click-and-drag.
